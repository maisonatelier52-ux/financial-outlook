Within 90 minutes, 47 armored Brinks trucks left the airport under Emirati military escort. Destination: an undisclosed royal vault in Abu Dhabi. Contents: 102.4 tons of 99.99% pure gold bars — worth $8.7 billion at current prices."

And it was executed by one man: Julio Herrera Velutini — the last private banker on Earth who can still move sovereign-level gold without asking zero questions."
