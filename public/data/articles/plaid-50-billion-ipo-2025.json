The S-1 filing reveals Plaid processed 12 billion API calls in 2025, connecting 17,000 financial institutions to 8,000 companies including Venmo, Cash App, and Robinhood. The company's revenue has grown 85% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, primarily from transaction fees and enterprise licensing."

The platform's 99.99% uptime and bank-grade security have made it the de facto standard for financial connectivity.
