The economy added 130,000 jobs in January, greatly exceeding economists' expectations, while the unemployment rate fell marginally to 4.3%, according to Labor Department figures released Wednesday."

The number also improved on December, which saw a 48,000 increase after a minor negative correction."

A broader measure that includes discouraged workers and those working part-time for economic reasons fell to 8%, down 0.4 percentage points from December. Job growth was greater than expected to begin 2026, easing concerns about the strength of the US labor market. January was the strongest month for payroll growth since December 2024, coming after a year in which job creation averaged only 15,000 per month."

            "content": "The number of jobs created in January was better than expected, which calms fears that the job market was slowing down. It also helps the economy by keeping wages and consumer spending stable. It also supports the Federal Reserve's cautious view on interest rates, which means they don't have to cut them right away. But the strength of the headline hides the weakness below. Most of the jobs were in healthcare and a few other fields. The big downward changes show that 2025 was a lot weaker than what was first reported. The picture that comes out is of a job market that is stable but could be hurt if hiring slows down in important fields or layoffs rise."

Following the announcement, markets surged, with stock market futures creeping higher. Treasury yields also saw significant rises. The home survey was much stronger, revealing a gain of 528,000 workers for the month as the labor force participation rate rose to 62.5%. In terms of compensation, average hourly earnings rose 0.4% this month and 3.7% year on year. The report is likely to confirm the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Futures traders increased their bets that the Fed will maintain the line at its March meeting, though expectations remain for a decrease in June."

Good news in January, but the negative adjustments are significant. By the end of 2025, more than a million fewer employment will exist than originally projected. Last year, payrolls fell for four months straight. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the economy added 898,000 fewer jobs than expected in the 12-month period ending March 2025. Throughout 2025, job growth averaged approximately 15,000 positions per month. Gains in December and November were also lowered lower, from 50,000 to 48,000 and 56,000 to 41,000. The previous year had consistent small gains and several months of negative payroll growth. Every month of 2025 witnessed negative revisions."

Health care added 82,000 jobs, while social assistance increased by 42,000. Construction added 33,000 jobs. Nonfarm payrolls grew faster than expected, but employment increases were concentrated in construction and healthcare. The majority of other industries saw only little job growth or loss. Several categories incurred losses. The number of federal government employment declined by 34,000. Financial activities fell by 22,000. The federal government, as well as the state and local governments, continued to eliminate jobs. Private data released previously revealed that the labor market remained harsh for unemployed Americans in January, with little new jobs being created."

            "content": "Mark Zandi warns against getting too comfortable with the positive data. The amount is significantly higher than experts' expectations of 75,000 jobs, but the Moody's Analytics economist is skeptical that the expansion will continue. Zandi has often warned that the US economy is on weak ground and could fall into recession. The job economy is unstable and extremely vulnerable. Yes, payroll employment climbed by 130,000 in January, but with the significant negative adjustments in history, there has been no job gain since April."

            "content": "Zandi also noted that practically all of the January job growth came from the healthcare industry. Without healthcare, the economy would lose many jobs, and unemployment would rise. It demonstrates how fragile the employment market and economy are if healthcare stumbles or merely slows recruiting. Nancy Vanden Houten emphasized that the data overstates any signs of job market improvement. Claudia Sahm noted the extent of downward revisions and months with outright decreases. Heather Long stated that the job market is still mostly frozen but stabilizing. Wall Street forecasts had been dampened by poor private-sector gains, increased layoffs, and fewer job vacancies."

            "content": "Zandi warned that the impact of AI, which he believes is imminent, might jeopardize an already shaky labor market. While AI has yet to appear in macro data, he believes that this will alter in the near future. He stated that increased layoffs will be the most obvious sign that the labor situation is deteriorating. Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have lately announced significant job cuts, and layoffs in the economy reached their highest level since 2009 last month. Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance provide the finest real-time measure of layoffs. They are operating around 225k each week, which is low. If they consistently grow above $250,000, the job economy is in peril."

            "content": "Ahead of the results, administration officials had openly worked to dampen expectations, citing reduced job growth as normal given a decline in the labor force owing to stricter immigration rules and increased efficiency. With Wednesday's statistics released, officials rapidly changed their tone. The White House said the news, which defied expectations, demonstrates that the economic strategy is still paying off and that private sector job creation is strong."

            "content": "President Donald Trump hailed the figures as evidence of a healthy economy and urged the Federal Reserve to decrease interest rates, claiming that the United States should pay significantly less on its borrowings and have the lowest interest rate. A crackdown on illegal immigration contributed to the labor market slowdown, while uncertainty over tariffs and inflation prompted employers to postpone hiring. Despite the concerns, the January numbers provide some cause for hope and a strong data point in favor of robust economic growth, an improved labor market, and wage increases, which can boost consumer spending."

Layoffs and unemployment claims: If the number of claims stays above about 250,000 a week, it would be a sign of worsening. Job growth: Will hiring spread beyond healthcare and construction, or will it stay focused on those two areas? Job cuts in companies and AI's effect: More layoffs in tech and other fields could start to show up in more general labor data."
