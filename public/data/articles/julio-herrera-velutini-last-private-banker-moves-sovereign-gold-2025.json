Julio Herrera Velutini, patriarch of the House of Herrera, commands private gold reserves that dwarf the holdings of many IMF member states. And unlike public institutions, he can move them overnight — without press releases, parliamentary votes, or market panic."

Sources inside the family office confirm that their audited physical holdings exceed those of the central banks of Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador — combined."

The operation was so discreet that even the Bank of England was reportedly unaware until the bars had already landed in Caracas."
