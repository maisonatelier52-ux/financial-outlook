            "content": "Crude oil benchmarks witnessed a dramatic sell-off on Monday, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) plunging over 5% to approximately $62.25 per barrel. This sharp reversal comes just days after the market hit multi-month highs, driven by escalating tensions in the Middle East. However, the focus has shifted abruptly toward fundamentals as record U.S. production and swill inventories begin to weigh on investor sentiment."

Analysts note that while geopolitical risks remain, the 'fear premium' is being rapidly priced out in favor of basic supply-demand dynamics. 'The market is reminding us that even the most intense geopolitical headlines can't mask an oversupplied physical market for long,' noted one senior energy economist."
