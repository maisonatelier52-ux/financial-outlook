      "content": "Texas has added 150,000 new homes in 2025 alone, with Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin leading the nation's housing construction boom. The combination of no state income tax, business-friendly policies, and massive tech migration has created the strongest housing market since the 2006 peak. Dallas-Fort Worth has officially become America's #1 housing market, with 42 homes selling per day and median prices reaching $550,000 — up 18% year-over-year."

      "content": "The growth has been fueled by corporate relocations — Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have all moved headquarters to Texas, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs. Austin's transformation from college town to tech hub is nearly complete, with Apple, Google, and Meta expanding massive campuses. The influx of California transplants has been particularly dramatic, with over 300,000 residents relocating from the Golden State since 2020, many bringing substantial equity from home sales."

      "content": "Unlike most major metros struggling with inventory shortages, Texas builders have responded aggressively to demand. New home construction is up 45% from pre-pandemic levels, with entire new cities emerging around Dallas and Austin. Master-planned communities like Celina (north of Dallas) have grown from 7,000 to 65,000 residents in five years. While this increased supply has moderated price growth compared to 2021-2022, values continue rising due to sustained job growth and population increases."
