The bill is on hold because the two sides can't agree on anything. At the White House, the crypto council will meet with leaders from trade groups in both fields. The main topic will be how the law treats interest and prizes for people who own stablecoins, which are tokens that are linked to the dollar."

The conference will help people meet each other, and President Trump wants more people to use digital money. Summer Mersinger from the Blockchain Association and other businesspeople want to work with politicians to make sure that the US stays the best place in the world for cryptocurrency."
