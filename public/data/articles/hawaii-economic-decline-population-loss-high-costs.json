Hawaii's population peaked in 2018 and has subsequently decreased steadily, owing primarily to individuals relocating to the mainland. Many locals say they are feeling the strain firsthand, as rising prices and weak wage growth make it more difficult to get by."

You factor in the cost of living compared to other places, it’s really high.\" \"We’re losing hardworking Hawaii families and getting people who are coming here basically for the lifestyle,\" said Steven Bond-Smith, the report's lead author. Bond-Smith stated that the state is progressively losing working families while attracting newcomers who can afford the high costs of living."

Many people have left because living costs are high and wages aren't rising quickly enough. Because of this, Hawaii is losing hard-working families and gaining wealthier newcomers who can afford its high cost of living. According to UHERO's research, Hawaii's economy is in bad shape because it hasn't diversified. It relies too much on tourism, and wages aren't keeping up with rising costs. Many people in the area are having to make impossible choices just to stay alive, which is making the economic crisis worse and could have long-term effects on the state's future."

            "content": "The underlying issue in Hawaii is poor economic performance, which is caused by an economy that has failed to keep up with the rest of the country. According to UHERO's analysis, while Hawaii's high cost of living is well recognized, the state's economic growth has lagged behind the national average. Beginning in the late 1980s, Bond-Smith stated that the state's compound annual growth rate, which had previously been consistent with the national average, declined, resulting in wage stagnation and a reduction in labor possibilities. Bond-Smith claims that after accounting for inflation, Hawaii's economic growth is more analogous to a decaying post-coal Rust Belt town."

Hawaii's tourist-centric economy lacks other sectors that are strong enough to compensate for tourism industry difficulties, resulting in stagnation."

However, Hawaii has both high costs and low incomes. The paper notes that tourism will continue to be the backbone of the state's economy for decades, and increasing value within tourism (such as through sports or event tourism) could assist spur growth. UHERO Executive Director Carl Bonham stated that reducing barriers to new sectors in Hawaii will be critical to diversifying the economy, even though such new industries are likely to emerge from existing activities such as tourism."

Know the rules of the city that are there to help workers and keep prices down. These laws can be used to raise wages and lower the cost of living. Hawaii will have to work hard over the next few years to fix its economy and keep its reputation as a paradise."
