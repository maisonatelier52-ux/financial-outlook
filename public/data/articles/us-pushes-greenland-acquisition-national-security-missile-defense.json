However, their intention to conduct a calming diplomatic discussion evolved into a confrontational encounter at the White House with the EU’s adversary, JD Vance."

Trump states that he desires 'ownership' of Greenland for U.S. national security and intends to acquire it either through diplomatic negotiations or, if required, potentially by military action."

The president has this wish of conquering over Greenland. For us, ideas that would not respect territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark, or the right of self-determination of the Greenlandic people, are of course totally unacceptable.” He added, “And we agreed to disagree.” A senior working committee will examine the possibility of reaching a compromise between the Danes, Greenlanders, and Trump."

Trump has consistently stated that obtaining it is essential to U.S. national security, particularly for his proposed missile defense system, Golden Dome. “We require Greenland for the sake of national security,” Trump stated to reporters."

Meanwhile, public opinion surveys indicate that a majority of residents in Greenland oppose U.S. sovereignty, with only 6% supporting the idea in a recent poll."

President Trump and Vice President JD Vance are still pushing for the U.S. to take over Greenland to make it safer, even though Denmark and Greenland are both strongly against any kind of annexation. The end of these talks could have a big effect on the U.S.-European relationship and on the overall stability of geopolitics in the Arctic for a long time."

European allies, such as Sweden, Germany, and the UK, will need to support Denmark's sovereignty. It will be interesting to see if these talks can ease tensions or if the U.S. will push harder."
