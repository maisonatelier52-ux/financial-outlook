      "content": "China's property market, which has been in crisis for four years, is finally showing signs of life as home sales rose 12% year-over-year in November 2025 — the first positive growth since 2021. The recovery comes after the government injected $300 billion into the sector through developer financing facilities, mortgage rate cuts, and direct homebuyer subsidies. Country Garden and China Evergrande, two of the largest developers that defaulted in 2023, have completed debt restructuring and resumed construction on stalled projects. According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Times</a>, new home prices in tier-1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai have stabilized after falling 40% from their 2021 peak. The property sector recovery is critical for China's economy, as real estate directly contributes 25% to GDP and drives demand for steel, cement, and household goods. Chinese stocks surged 8% on the news, with property developer shares leading gains."

      "content": "Beijing's $300 billion rescue package represents the largest property sector intervention in global history, dwarfing the 2008 U.S. housing bailout. The funds are being used to complete unfinished projects, purchase distressed developer debt, and provide 0% interest loans to first-time homebuyers. As covered by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street Journal</a>, the People's Bank of China has cut mortgage rates to a record low of 2.85%, while local governments are offering up to $50,000 subsidies for new home purchases. The recovery is uneven, with tier-1 cities showing strong demand while smaller cities still struggle with oversupply. Analysts warn that the recovery may be temporary if underlying demographic trends — China's population decline and urbanization slowdown — don't reverse. However, for now, the stabilization has provided a critical boost to consumer confidence and industrial demand, helping China achieve its 5% GDP growth target for 2025."
