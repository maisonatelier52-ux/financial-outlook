      "content": "In a historic announcement during his first post-election address, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed that the United States will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve similar to the country's oil and gold reserves. The Treasury Department will begin purchasing 1 million BTC over the next five years, positioning the U.S. government as the largest holder of the world's leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin immediately surged past $108,000, marking a new all-time high and completing a 150% rally since the election. The announcement represents the biggest policy victory for the crypto industry in its 15-year history and signals the beginning of a new era of mainstream adoption."

      "content": "Trump emphasized that Bitcoin represents the future of money and national security. The strategic reserve will be funded through reallocation of existing federal assets and congressional appropriations. The President-elect cited the need to protect against dollar devaluation and maintain technological sovereignty as primary motivations. This move follows similar actions by countries like El Salvador and Bhutan, but at a scale that dwarfs all previous efforts. The U.S. strategic reserve will hold more Bitcoin than all corporate treasuries and ETFs combined. Crypto markets reacted with euphoria, as Ethereum, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies also posted double-digit gains. Institutional investors accelerated their buying, with Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust seeing $1.2 billion in inflows in the 24 hours following the announcement."
