            "content": "Prices have been going up for months and then suddenly dropped, which has made investors lose faith in the leaders of Big Tech and AI. People are still selling IT stocks, even though they are making a lot of money. Prices seem way too high, and more and more people are starting to believe that the AI boom isn't over yet. The downturn spread from Wall Street to Asian markets, showing how closely linked trade is around the world. When tech stocks in the U.S. go down, the whole world feels it. Investors aren't leaving the markets; they're just moving to things that seem safer, like gold and other safe havens."

Even when they achieve higher-than-expected profits, tech stocks face criticism since their valuations have skyrocketed as they have grown to dominate markets. Big Tech stocks are under fire for skyrocketing prices as a result of their market domination over the years. U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, with losses in Advanced Micro Devices, Palantir, and other technology companies, as investors were concerned about high valuations and if Wall Street's AI surge had peaked."

It also provided a revenue prediction for the beginning of 2026 that outperformed analysts' forecasts. Advanced Micro Devices fell 17% as the chipmaker estimated quarterly revenue that disappointed investors and signaled it is struggling to compete with AI powerhouse Nvidia. Nvidia declined 3.4%, while the PHLX semiconductor index plummeted 4.4%. Palantir fell over 12%, reversing the previous day's significant gains, which were fueled by the AI data company's outstanding quarterly earnings. Alphabet slumped over 2% ahead of its quarterly earnings after the bell."

Some software companies have added to their previous losses amid concerns that fast evolving AI may undermine sector stalwarts. Snowflake plummeted 4.6%, while Datadog lost 3.3%."

The ride-hailing business posted statistics for the most recent quarter that fell short of analysts' estimates, as well as a profit forecast for the current quarter that was lower than analysts' expectations. Nonetheless, several tech stocks rose, like Super Micro Computer, which increased by 13.8%. Super Micro Computer's shares rose 13.8% after the business upped its annual revenue prediction due to strong demand for its AI-optimized servers."

Despite reporting high profits, Nintendo's stock fell 11%. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.6%, setting a new record. Investors dumping AI-related equities switched to less expensive companies that waited out the tech rise. The S&P 500 value index rose for the fifth consecutive session, while the S&P 500 growth index fell. Even as the S&P 500 fell, seven of the eleven S&P 500 sector indices increased, led by energy and followed by materials."

Investors will be paying attention to the next earnings reports from big tech companies, advice on how much to spend on AI, and U.S. economic data that could change their expectations for interest rates. In Asia, watch to see if losses get worse or if buyers come in after recent drops. A big question still needs to be answered: is this just a healthy reset after a big rally, or is it the start of a bigger shift away from tech-heavy markets?"
