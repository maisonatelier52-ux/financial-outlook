      "content": "Bitcoin shattered the psychological $100,000 barrier on December 5, 2024, reaching an all-time high of $103,800 before settling around $101,500. The historic milestone comes just weeks after the U.S. presidential election, with pro-crypto sentiment driving unprecedented institutional demand. According to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoinDesk</a>, the rally was fueled by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have accumulated over $30 billion in net assets since their January 2024 launch. BlackRock's IBIT alone added $2.1 billion in Bitcoin purchases in the week leading up to the breakout. The surge pushed Bitcoin's market capitalization above $2 trillion for the first time, making it larger than silver and approaching the market cap of Saudi Aramco. Options markets show traders expecting further gains, with $110,000 and $120,000 strike calls seeing heavy volume. The move also triggered a wave of liquidations, with over $1.5 billion in short positions wiped out in a single trading session as bears capitulated."

      "content": "The $100K breakthrough reflects a fundamental shift in Bitcoin's investor base, with institutions now dominating trading volumes. As reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloomberg Crypto</a>, pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds have begun allocating to Bitcoin through ETF wrappers, bringing legitimacy and sustained buying pressure. MicroStrategy announced plans to purchase an additional $2 billion worth of Bitcoin, while rumors circulate that major tech companies are considering treasury allocations. The rally also coincides with Bitcoin's hashrate hitting new all-time highs above 700 EH/s, demonstrating network security and miner confidence. Analysts point to the upcoming 2024 halving event, which will reduce Bitcoin's issuance rate to just 450 BTC per day, as a key supply constraint that could drive prices even higher. With institutional adoption accelerating and supply getting tighter, many crypto veterans believe $100K is just the beginning of a multi-year bull cycle that could take Bitcoin to $200,000 or beyond by 2025."
