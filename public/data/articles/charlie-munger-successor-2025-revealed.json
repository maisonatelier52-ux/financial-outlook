The announcement came during the 2025 shareholder meeting alongside the appointment of two new vice chairs. The 94-year-old Buffett confirmed he plans to step down in 2027, marking the end of the most successful investing partnership in history with Charlie Munger, who passed away in 2023."

Greg Abel, who has run Berkshire's non-insurance operations since 2018, has earned praise for his operational excellence and capital allocation skills. The addition of two vice chairs — one for insurance and one for investments — ensures continuity of Buffett's decentralized management philosophy."

Abel's track record of growing Berkshire Energy from $30 billion to over $150 billion in value speaks for itself. The company's $325 billion cash position gives the new leadership team unprecedented firepower for future acquisitions. Buffett emphasized that Berkshire will continue its buy-and-hold-forever approach with an emphasis on quality businesses at reasonable prices."
