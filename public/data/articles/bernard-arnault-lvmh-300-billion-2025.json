      "content": "Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, has become the first European to reach a $300 billion net worth, surpassing American tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. The milestone was achieved after LVMH shares surged 40% on the Paris exchange, driven by blockbuster Q4 results and the surprise announcement of a Dior x Nike collaboration. The French luxury conglomerate reported €92 billion in annual revenue — up 15% from 2024 — with Asia-Pacific sales growing 28% as China's middle class rebounds from the property crisis."

      "content": "Arnault's empire, which includes Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Tiffany & Co., and Sephora, now generates more revenue than the GDP of entire countries like Luxembourg and Malta. The 76-year-old billionaire's wealth has grown by €150 billion since the start of 2025, making him the fastest-rising member of the $200 billion club. His family's control of 48% of LVMH gives them unparalleled influence over the global luxury goods market, which is projected to reach €1.2 trillion by 2030."

      "content": "Arnault's strategy of acquiring iconic brands and maintaining creative independence has proven remarkably resilient. While American tech stocks have faced regulatory headwinds, luxury goods remain a safe haven for the global elite. The company's focus on experiential retail — flagship stores in Paris, Milan, and New York that function as cultural destinations — has driven record foot traffic and conversion rates. Arnault's children, who hold key executive positions across the group, ensure family control for generations to come."
