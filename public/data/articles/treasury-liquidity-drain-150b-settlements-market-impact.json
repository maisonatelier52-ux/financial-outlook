            "content": "Liquidity drains will continue this week as the Treasury settles another $62 billion in T-bills. This will continue on February 17, when it settles around $35 billion in coupons, requiring approximately $90 billion to be raised this week for settlement. The bill timetable for the week of February 17 may add an additional $60 billion to that amount. This means that in the next two weeks, we could see $150 billion in settlements. At the present, it appears that no money is coming from \"cash on the sidelines\" to fund the debt."

            "content": "Anyway, the point is that the cash is coming from someplace; some of it looks to be showing up on dealers' balance sheets, which may be significant if it affects liquidity in other areas of the market, like leverage. Given the stock market's performance and the position of reserve balances, margin levels most likely fell in January. I would be surprised if they increased in any significant way. We are only concerned about this because of the influence it has had on our own market, notably the direction of the 5-year cross-currency basis swap and the SPY. That pattern has continued for nearly four years. According to this chart, dollar funding circumstances are currently favorable, which is likely one of the reasons why assets like as Bitcoin and some sectors of the equity market have suffered while the larger index has held together. If demand for US dollar hedges fluctuates, so will the flow of liquidity."

            "content": "A lot of Treasury bonds will be issued over the next two weeks, which will take money out of the financial system and make it harder to get cash. When liquidity gets tighter, risky assets like crypto and some parts of the stock market often have a hard time, even if the major indexes stay the same. At the same time, currency tensions, like a weakening yen and the possibility of intervention, make the global market even more risky."

USD/JPY was already trading just below 158, and the win suggests it will fall further. At this moment, the BOJ is dragging its feet, and the government is implementing extremely lax fiscal policy, so it makes perfect sense for the USD/JPY to climb higher, and the prospect of intervention appears out of place, in my opinion. But it's evident they're concerned about the 160 level."

            "content": "A weekly technical chart of the USD/JPY demonstrates why. After 160, the next level of resistance is roughly 164, and that's it, because it appears that 220 comes next. It obviously sounds ridiculous, but talking about the 10-year JGB trading above 2% sounded strange a year ago as well. Of course, the gap between the JPY and the interest rate differential is under greater strain given how far they have already separated. At this point, only a strengthening yen, dropping Japanese rates, or rising US rates will reverse this trend. I'm not sure which one happens."

The yen also retraced losses against other currencies after reaching its all-time low against the Swiss franc and close to its lowest level since the euro's inception. \"While the initial yen weakness may not have played out, the outlook for the yen is still one which is likely to struggle to strengthen,\" according to Sim Moh Siong, an economist at OCBC. \"At least in the near term, there's also concern about intervention risk, which may be capping the upside for dollar-yen.\""
