      "content": "The European Central Bank has achieved its 2% inflation target for the first time since 2013, marking the end of a 15-year era that included negative interest rates, quantitative easing, and unprecedented monetary stimulus. Eurozone inflation fell to exactly 2.0% in November 2025, down from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022. ECB President Christine Lagarde announced the achievement in Frankfurt, declaring \"mission accomplished\" after the most aggressive monetary tightening cycle in ECB history. The central bank raised rates from -0.5% to 4.75% over 24 months, causing severe economic pain in southern Europe but finally taming runaway prices. According to <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Economist</a>, the victory came at a cost: Eurozone GDP contracted 1.2% in 2024, unemployment rose to 8.5%, and Italy and Spain required emergency EU funding to avoid debt crises. The euro strengthened 3% against the dollar on the news as investors anticipated policy normalization."

      "content": "With inflation at target, the ECB has begun the delicate process of policy normalization, cutting rates by 25 basis points in December to 4.5% — the first cut since 2019. The central bank plans gradual reductions over 18 months, aiming for a neutral rate around 2-3% by mid-2026. As reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/economics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloomberg Economics</a>, the ECB is also unwinding its €8 trillion balance sheet, reducing bond holdings by €50 billion monthly. The normalization process risks derailing the fragile recovery, with Germany already in recession and France struggling with 10% unemployment. However, Lagarde has signaled that price stability takes priority over growth, and the ECB will maintain restrictive policy until inflation is sustainably at target. Bond markets have responded positively, with Italian 10-year yields falling to 3.5% — their lowest since 2021 — as investors bet that the worst is over for European debt markets."
