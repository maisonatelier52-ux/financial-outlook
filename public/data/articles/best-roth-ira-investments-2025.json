      "content": "Financial planners emphasize that consistent investing in broad-market index funds inside a Roth IRA is the most reliable path to millionaire status. An investor contributing the maximum $7,500 annually from age 25 could accumulate over $4.2 million by age 65 at 10% average returns — all tax-free. The combination of compound growth and tax elimination creates wealth multiplication that traditional accounts can't match. These seven funds represent the consensus picks across major brokerages for long-term, set-it-and-forget-it investing."
