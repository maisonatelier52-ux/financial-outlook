      "content": "Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, has become the first Asian to reach a $200 billion net worth, overtaking Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg to claim the #4 spot on the global rich list. The milestone was achieved as Reliance Jio's 5G rollout reached 100% coverage across India, adding 150 million new subscribers in the past 12 months. The telecom giant's valuation now exceeds $150 billion, while Reliance Retail has become the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer with 25,000 stores."

The JioMart platform has revolutionized e-commerce in India, combining online ordering with same-day delivery from physical stores. The company's pivot to renewable energy has been spectacular, with Reliance Green Energy now valued at $75 billion after securing $10 billion in government contracts for solar and hydrogen production. Ambani's strategic vision has transformed India from a backwater economy into the world's fastest-growing major market."

      "content": "Mukesh Ambani's success is particularly remarkable given India's complex regulatory environment and infrastructure challenges. His ability to navigate bureaucracy while building world-class companies has made him a national hero. The Ambani family now controls assets worth more than the GDP of Pakistan and Bangladesh combined. Mukesh's children — Akash, Isha, and Anant — hold key executive positions across the conglomerate, ensuring generational wealth transfer. The youngest, Anant, leads the green energy division and has become one of the most influential young business leaders in Asia."
