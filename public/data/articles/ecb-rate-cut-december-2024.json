      "content": "The European Central Bank delivered its fourth consecutive interest rate cut on December 12, 2024, lowering the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 3.0%. President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the decision was driven by weakening growth across the eurozone, with GDP growth revised down to just 0.7% for 2024. According to <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ECB</a> projections, inflation has fallen to 2.3% and is expected to reach the 2% target by mid-2025, giving policymakers room to ease monetary policy aggressively. Germany, the bloc's largest economy, officially entered a technical recession with two consecutive quarters of negative growth, while manufacturing activity across Europe remains deeply contracted. The euro fell 0.8% against the dollar following the announcement, trading at $1.05 as markets priced in additional rate cuts in early 2025. Lagarde stated the ECB would continue to take a 'data-dependent' approach but signaled growing concern about below-trend growth and rising unemployment, which reached 6.5% across the eurozone."

      "content": "The ECB's dovish stance contrasts sharply with the Federal Reserve's more cautious approach, creating the widest monetary policy divergence in years. As reported by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Times</a>, the interest rate differential between US and EU rates has reached 150 basis points, the highest since 2000, putting downward pressure on the euro and making imports more expensive for European consumers. The weak euro provides some relief for eurozone exporters but exacerbates inflation risks from energy and commodity imports. Germany's industrial sector continues to struggle with high energy costs following the loss of Russian natural gas, while automakers face intense competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers. ECB officials hinted that rates could fall to 2.5% or lower by mid-2025 if growth remains weak, with some economists predicting a return to near-zero rates if recession deepens. The divergence has also triggered capital outflows from Europe to US markets, with European equity indices underperforming by 12% in 2024."
