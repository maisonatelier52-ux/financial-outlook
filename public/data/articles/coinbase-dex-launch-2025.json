      "content": "Coinbase has launched a fully decentralized exchange on its Base Layer 2 network, challenging Uniswap's dominance in the $150 billion DEX market. The new exchange, called 'Coinbase DEX,' offers zero trading fees for the first year and integrates directly with Coinbase's 100+ million user base. Initial liquidity pools launched with $5 billion in total value locked, instantly making it the third-largest DEX by TVL. The exchange uses an advanced automated market maker (AMM) design that reduces impermanent loss by 90% compared to traditional DEXes. As reported by <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Block</a>, the launch caused UNI token to drop 25% as traders anticipate a fierce market share battle. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the DEX will eventually process all Base network trades, creating a seamless bridge between centralized and decentralized finance."

      "content": "The Coinbase DEX represents a strategic bet that the future of crypto trading is hybrid — combining the security and compliance of centralized exchanges with the permissionless innovation of DeFi. Users can trade with their existing Coinbase accounts and see positions reflected across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Institutional clients get access to deep liquidity pools previously only available on centralized order books. According to <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Decrypt</a>, the DEX supports over 1,000 trading pairs at launch with plans to add derivatives and perpetual futures in Q1 2026. Base network activity has surged 500% since the announcement, processing over 10 million daily transactions. The move positions Coinbase to capture value across the entire crypto trading spectrum, from casual retail users to sophisticated institutional traders. COIN stock jumped 15% on the news as investors see the DEX as a major revenue driver."
