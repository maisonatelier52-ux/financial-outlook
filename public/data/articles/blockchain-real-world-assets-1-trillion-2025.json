The fund offers institutional-grade yields with blockchain settlement speeds, attracting pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices seeking both return and transparency. UBS has followed with $200 billion in tokenized bonds, while Goldman Sachs launched a $150 billion real estate tokenization platform for private equity."

      "content": "The real breakthrough is liquidity. Traditionally illiquid assets like commercial real estate and private equity can now be fractionalized and traded instantly. A $50 million office building that once took 90 days to sell can now be tokenized into $50 shares that trade continuously. This has created entirely new markets for assets that were previously locked in long-term holdings. Retail investors can now participate in opportunities previously reserved for institutions with $10 million minimums."
