      "content": "Canada's real estate market is experiencing its most severe correction in three decades, with average home prices in Toronto and Vancouver declining 25% from their 2023 peaks. The downturn has been exacerbated by a perfect storm of factors: the Bank of Canada's aggressive interest rate hikes bringing mortgage rates to 6.5%, a complete ban on foreign property purchases implemented in 2024, and new stress test requirements forcing buyers to qualify at rates 2% above market rates. <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/canada-housing-market-correction-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Real estate economists</a> warn that the correction could deepen further, with some models suggesting another 15% decline if economic conditions worsen. The impact has been particularly severe in the condo segment, where oversupply from years of rapid development has collided with reduced foreign demand."

      "content": "The foreign buyer ban, which prohibits non-residents and non-Canadians from purchasing residential property for two years, has fundamentally altered market dynamics in cities like Vancouver, where foreign investment previously accounted for up to 15% of transactions. <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada-housing-market-foreign-buyer-ban-impact-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Market analysts</a> report that luxury properties in Vancouver's Westside and Toronto's Yorkville district have seen the sharpest price declines, with some high-end condos selling for 30-40% below their 2023 valuations. The correction has also exposed vulnerabilities in the condo investment market, where many speculators who purchased pre-construction units are now facing negative equity as completion dates approach with market values below purchase prices."

      "content": "While major metropolitan areas face significant headwinds, some regional markets have shown resilience. Calgary and Edmonton, buoyed by strong oil sector employment, have maintained stable prices, while smaller cities like Halifax and Ottawa have experienced more modest declines. <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/economy/canada-housing-correction-regional-analysis-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Housing policy experts</a> note that the federal government faces pressure to adjust policies, with some provinces calling for a relaxation of the foreign buyer ban to stabilize markets. However, political considerations around housing affordability for Canadians make any reversal unlikely. The correction has provided some relief for first-time buyers, though higher mortgage rates mean monthly payments remain elevated despite lower purchase prices. Looking forward, market participants expect a prolonged period of consolidation before sustainable recovery begins, potentially requiring 3-5 years to absorb excess inventory and stabilize prices."
