      "content": "The Bank of Japan has executed the largest currency intervention in world history, spending $500 billion to prevent the yen from collapsing below 180 per U.S. dollar. The massive operation, revealed in December 2025 data, shows Japan's central bank sold $500 billion worth of foreign reserves and purchased yen in coordinated moves across multiple trading sessions. The intervention temporarily stabilized the currency, but the yen has since weakened back to 178 per dollar as fundamental economic pressures persist. According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reuters</a>, Japan's foreign reserves have fallen to $800 billion from $1.3 trillion in just six months, sparking concerns about the sustainability of intervention efforts. The move comes as Japan struggles with a massive trade deficit, zero interest rates, and an aging population that's importing more than it exports."

      "content": "Japan's intervention has triggered retaliatory moves from other Asian central banks, with South Korea, Taiwan, and China all stepping up currency market operations. The U.S. Treasury Department issued a rare statement expressing \"concern\" about competitive devaluations, while the IMF warned that currency wars could destabilize global trade. As reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/economics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloomberg Economics</a>, the yen's weakness has made Japanese exports 35% cheaper in dollar terms, devastating manufacturing sectors in South Korea and Germany. Japan's automotive and electronics exports have surged, while competitors struggle to compete. The intervention has also impacted global bond markets, with Japanese investors selling $200 billion in U.S. Treasuries to fund the currency defense, pushing yields higher worldwide. Currency traders predict that without structural economic reforms, Japan will be forced to continue massive interventions, potentially exhausting its reserves by 2026."
