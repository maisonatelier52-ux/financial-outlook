The UK-based fintech has disrupted the $800 billion global remittance market with its transparent pricing and instant cross-border transfers. Wise now processes 25 million customer transactions monthly across 160 countries, with average transfer fees of just 0.5% compared to traditional banks' 7%."

Wise's banking license allows it to hold customer deposits and lend against them, creating a powerful balance sheet that generated $3.2 billion in net interest income last quarter alone. The platform's API has become the standard for fintech integration, powering services from Shopify to Uber."
