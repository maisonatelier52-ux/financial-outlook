Although some believe they will remain unchanged, more Americans are optimistic than pessimistic about the stock market (50% vs. 25%) and economic growth (49% vs. 36%). The outlook for interest rates is mixed (41% positive vs. 36% negative), with more expecting unemployment and inflation to rise than fall. Sixty-two percent expect increased inflation and fifty percent higher unemployment."

The majority of adults in the United States foresee good momentum in the stock market and general economic growth, and the public is slightly more likely to believe interest rates will fall than climb. These views represent a turnaround from the pessimism witnessed last spring during market turbulence, albeit optimism has not yet recovered to previous highs. At the same time, Americans foresee prolonged economic distress, with a clear majority expecting inflation to rise and half believing unemployment will climb. These forecasts vary substantially by party, with Republicans expecting positive outcomes across the board, while Democrats and independents are more likely to expect worsening situations."

            "content": "This picture shows a country that is both cautiously hopeful and still worried. People are beginning to think that the stock market and the economy as a whole could get better. This is a sign that confidence is slowly coming back after last year's chaos. But the good feelings end at the kitchen table. Most Americans still expect prices to go up and jobs to be less secure, which have a direct effect on their daily lives. That gap matters: when people are worried about inflation or their jobs, they tend to spend less. Consumer spending is a big part of the U.S. economy. The difference in expectations between the two parties also suggests that people's feelings about the economy may stay unstable and be influenced as much by politics as by data."

In April, Americans' optimistic predictions about the stock market fell as Trump's tariff proposals went into effect and the global market became less stable. Public expectations that the stock market will rise at least a little bit fell 32 percentage points, from a record high of 61% to 29%, which is the same as the record low. The number of Americans who think the market will go up in the next few months has gone up by 21 points (50%), while the number who think it will go down has gone down by 33 points to 25%. Another 17% of adults in the U.S. think the market will stay the same. Americans' trust in the stock market has grown, but it hasn't reached the all-time high set in January 2025."

Since then, views have been measured 11 times, although not during the late 2007-early 2009 Great Recession. The most recent data come from a Gallup poll conducted between January 2 and 17, 2017. The previous time the questions were asked, in April 2025, public mood had deteriorated dramatically from three months before, following President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on most US trading partners, which increased economic uncertainty. The more cheerful assessments in January 2025 were mostly due to Republicans' excitement about the economy under the new Trump administration."

According to a recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, Trump's disapproval rating for the economy was at an all-time high for both of his terms. Thirty-six percent of those surveyed said they agreed with how Trump was handling the economy, while 59 percent said they disagreed."

Job security will also be important. If there are signs of layoffs or a slower hiring process, people may not feel as confident. A lot of families are also waiting to see if the cost of borrowing goes down. This would lower the cost of credit cards, car loans, and mortgages. Also, pay attention to whether people keep spending or cut back. Pullbacks are a sign that people are becoming more concerned about the economy. In the end, the outlook will depend on whether the good news about the market and growth starts to match what people see in their own wallets."
